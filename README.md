# Lung_cancer_diagnosis_using_CNN
Deep Learning-Based Computer-Aided Early Lung Cancer Diagnosis uses CNNs to detect lung cancer from chest X-rays and CT scans. It enhances early detection through deep learning, improving accuracy and efficiency. The project focuses on data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and ethical compliance in AI-driven medical applications.
